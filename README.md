# Challenge!
Creating a ping app with Go
## What I have created
This is a fully functional IPv4 Ping request with a variable TTL parameter.
IPv6 Is almost working I just need some guidance
Due to exams I was not able to add more functions.
## How to use it 
Usage of Ping (bold means mandatory):

  - **IP** string: Ip address (default "nil")
  - IPV6: True if its a IPV6 protocol
  - **TTL** int: Sets time to live. (default 1)
